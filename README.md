A program that basically simulate the dice system in fantasy role playing games
The program contains two main parts. First part simulates the d20 dice system. The users can throw the dice as much as they want with the bonus they want. If everything goes well, a pop  pops up and shows the result. If the result is less than zero, an error message is shown. 
 In second part of the program, a custom tableView class that includes a cumstom cells  is found. A button is found below the screen. The button redirects the users to the dice save page. This page saves the stated dices to the sqlite database. The list from the second page shows the saved dices. The transition between the two pages is done by swiping via PageViewController.
